description: 'Action selection relies on the coordinated activity of striatal direct
  and indirect pathway medium spiny neurons (dMSNs and iMSNs, respectively). Loss
  of dopamine in Parkinson’s disease is thought to disrupt this balance. While dopamine
  replacement

  with levodopa may restore normal function, the development of involuntary movements
  (levodopa-induced dyskinesia [LID]) limits therapy. How chronic dopamine loss and
  replacement with levodopa modulate the firing of identified MSNs in behaving

  animals is unknown. Using optogenetically labeled striatal single-unit recordings,
  we assess circuit dysfunction in parkinsonism and LID. Counter to current models,
  we found that following dopamine depletion, iMSN firing was elevated only during
  periods of immobility, while dMSN firing was dramatically and persistently reduced.
  Most notably, we identified a subpopulation of dMSNs with abnormally high levodopa-evoked
  firing rates, which correlated specifically with dyskinesia. These findings provide
  key insights into the circuit mechanisms underlying parkinsonism and LID, with implications
  for developing targeted therapies.'
